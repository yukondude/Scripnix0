Installation using Subversion (Recommended)
-------------------------------------------

As root, execute the following shell commands:

# cd /usr/local/
# mkdir scripnix
# svn checkout http://scripnix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ scripnix
# mv bin bin.old
# ln -s scripnix/bin
# mv sbin sbin.old
# ln -s scripnix/sbin
# sbin/install-scripnix

You may want to copy back any files from bin.old/ and sbin.old/ to the new bin/
and sbin/ symlinked directories. They will be ignored by future Subversion
updates to Scripnix.

To update the Scripnix files, execude the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/local/scripnix
# svn update

Installation without using Subversion
-------------------------------------

Download the Scripnix tarball to a scratch directory and unpack it. Copy the
contents of the bin/ and sbin/ directories to /usr/local/bin/ and /usr/local/sbin/
respectively. Then run the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/local/sbin/
# install-scripnix

To update the Scripnix files, download the new tarball and replace the files in
/usr/local/bin/ and /usr/local/sbin/ with their new versions.

Configuration
-------------

To add the project's functions and aliases to your shell environment, source the
/usr/local/bin/rc.bash script from your account's .bashrc script, or the
/usr/local/sbin/src.bash script from the root user's .bashrc script.

You may need to override the values of some of the variables in the
bin/conf.bash and sbin/sconf.bash files. Rather than editing those files (which
may be updated in future releases), make changes to the appropriate
/etc/scripnix/conf.bash or /etc/scripnix/sconf.bash systemwide configuration
files (created by the install-scripnix script). Individual users may also create
~/.scripnix/conf.bash files in their home directories to further override the
systemwide settings.

Conventions
-----------

* Scripts suitable for all users are under the bin/ directory. Root-only scripts
  are under the sbin/ directory.
* Configuration files (that are sourced by other scripts) are named with a .bash
  extension.
* In general, root-only configuration files are prefixed with the letter 's'.
