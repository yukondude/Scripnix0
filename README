Scripnix Project
================

General utility shell scripts.

Written in 2007-2008 by Dave Rogers <yukondude-strudel-gmail-fullstop-com>.
The contents of the Scripnix project are released into the Public Domain.

Installation
------------

Copy the contents of the bin directory to /usr/local/bin, and the contents of
the sbin directory to /usr/local/sbin. The /usr/local/bin directory must be
added to the PATH of all users, and the /usr/local/sbin directory must also be
added to the PATH of the root user.

If the /usr/local/[s]bin directories don't exist, or are empty, you could
instead checkout the project's files through Subversion and replace the
/usr/local subdirectories with symlinks to the checked-out subdirectories.

To add the project's functions and aliases to your shell environment, source the
bin/rc.bash script from your account's .bashrc script, or the sbin/src.bash
script from the root user's .bashrc script.

Configuration
-------------

You may need to override the values of some of the variables in the
bin/conf.bash and sbin/sconf.bash files. Rather than editing those files,
put assignments into new bin/user-conf.bash or sbin/suser-conf.bash files,
respectively. Those assignments will automatically override the ones in the
supplied project files.

Conventions
-----------

* Scripts suitable for all users are under the bin directory. Root-only scripts
  are under the sbin directory.
* Non-executable files (that are sourced by other scripts) are named with a
  .bash extension.
* Non-executable files under the sbin directory are prefixed with the letter
  's'.
